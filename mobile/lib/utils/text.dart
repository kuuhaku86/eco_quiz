  "• Multiplication as Repeated Addition: Multiplication is defined as repeatedly adding the same number. For example, 2  3 is the same as 2 + 2 + 2, which equals 6.  This fundamental concept is crucial for understanding multiplication.  \n\n• Factors and Products: The numbers multiplied together are called factors, and the result is the product. For instance, in 2  4 = 8, 2 and 4 are the factors, and 8 is the product. This terminology is essential for working with multiplication problems.  \n\n• Commutative Property: The order of factors does not affect the product;  2  4 equals 4  2 (both equal 8). This commutative property simplifies calculations and understanding of multiplication.",
  "• Reptilian Locomotion and Etymology: Reptiles, whose name derives from the Latin \"repere\" (to crawl), typically move by dragging their abdomen close to the ground.  This characteristic is a defining feature of the group. \n\n• Reptilian Characteristics:  Reptiles are cold-blooded, lung-breathing, oviparous (egg-laying) vertebrates. Their bodies are covered in tough scales, and some species, like tortoises, possess protective shells. \n\n• Reptilian Diet and Adaptations:  Most reptiles are carnivorous, although some are herbivorous.  Many possess adaptations like venom (in snakes), camouflage (in chameleons), or bright warning colors to aid in hunting or defense.",
